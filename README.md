# MAGD-150-Assignments

[Lab 1](https://github.com/RavenDreda/MAGD-150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/f17magd150lab01_McLaughlin) required that we adhere to the theme of "buildings" in Processing using grayscale for our color.  We needed to use basic shapes such as rectangles and ellipses.

[Lab 4](https://github.com/RavenDreda/MAGD-150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/f17_magd_150_Lab_4_McLaughlin) was all about mouse interactivity.  That is, we needed the code to be connected to the movement of the mouse using mouseX and mouseY.

[Lab 5](https://github.com/RavenDreda/MAGD-150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/f17_magd_150_Lab_05_McLaughlin) had us use buttons in order to cause changes to our code.  The theme for this particular assignment was Television.

[Lab 7](https://github.com/RavenDreda/MAGD-150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/f17_magd_150_Lab_07_McLaughlin) had us implement PVectors into our code while following a carnival theme.

[Lab 9](https://github.com/RavenDreda/MAGD-150-Assignments/tree/gh-pages/f17_magd_150_Lab_09_McLaughlin) brought in the use of outside sound, video, and images.  The theme here was documentary.
